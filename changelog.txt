The application is in a huge state of flux right now as I take the best of model.js and jSQL.js to create a hybrid
relational/noSQL solution. For now I'll call it SQLish (lib/SQLish.js)
Oh... check out the new eventing mechanism as well, lib/eventHub.js - it's awesome, I can't wait to put it into action!

Tons of bug fixes and rewrites today. model's domDataNodes is still buggy and needs better structure.

Complete rewrite of the model and data-binding via dataSpies... more on that soon.

Added a Model service for a lightweight model (when jSQL is overkill)
The sample app in the examples directory showcases the new model
