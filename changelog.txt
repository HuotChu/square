Current SquareDB is now split into 6 modules in ./lib/squaredb/ NOT ./lib/squareDB.js
### 11/03/2015
New experimental branch added for squareDB work. This branch is usually broken, however running a diff on this branch and master is a great way to see the coming changes.
### 10/29/2015
JATO has been renamed to Square[JS]!
### 10/27/2015
SQLish.js has been renamed to squareDB! (Structured QUery And RElational DataBase) It now supports many SQL commands (see tests/squareDBTests.js) using combinatory logic/lambda expressions for a truly awesome client-side data model.

While trying to create the most useful and efficient model API possible, I created this test on jsPerf: http://jsperf.com/iteration-race/2
Based on these results, relational data stores in JavaScript are up to 60% faster than data collections, yet no one stores data this way on the client...
until now.  Take a look at the lib/SQLish.js API as it's reaching a whole new level of WOW!  The SQLish tests show implementation coolness in test/SQLishTests.js.
### 10/18/2015
The application is in a huge state of flux right now as I take the best of model.js and jSQL.js to create a hybrid
relational/noSQL solution. For now I'll call it SQLish (lib/SQLish.js)
Oh... check out the new eventing mechanism as well, lib/eventHub.js - it's awesome, I can't wait to put it into action!
### 10/01/2015
Tons of bug fixes and rewrites today. model's domDataNodes is still buggy and needs better structure.
### 9/29/2015
Complete rewrite of the model and data-binding via dataSpies... more on that soon.
### 8/14/2015
Added a Model service for a lightweight model (when jSQL is overkill)
The sample app in the examples directory showcases the new model
### 6/19/2015
There is now an examples directory where I can showcase the power and sensibility of JATO
### 6/15/2015
Temple now supports repeating elements AND Temple can now attach event handlers!
