# Square[JS]
Modern MVC Application Development, Structured Query API, & Client-Side Relational Database

## What is SquareJS?
Square is an application framework written in JavaScript that gets your project off the ground with lightning speed. The first thing that should excite you about the Square framework is the tiny footprint.  Square unminified is smaller than any other comparable minified framework!  Plus, Square provides a true MVC architecture which uses eventing rather than digest loops, HTML that validates, AJAX calls returns Promises, and the model supports both relational and non-relational approaches to storing and retrieving data.

## What about performance?
SquareJS provides awesome power and speed.  Square offers compact, powerful functions using native JavaScript methodology "under the hood" as much as possible. Most frameworks waste operations on extraneous function calls, looping mechanisms, and costly DOM lookups.  Square gets the job done using optimized code structures, multiple caching mechanisms, and best of all... you should never need to do a DOM lookup in JATO.  Rather, Square caches DOM nodes you care about as properties of the view object which makes retrieval fast and easy.  Speaking of fast and easy, the view knows how to tear itself down and it cleans up all associated event handlers as it implodes.  This brings up another good point which is that JATO is not only fast in terms of applications speed, it also results in rapid architecture and development.

## This framework is in Alpha
Look for daily refinements :)
Contribution instructions, license, and other stuff will be added... eventually.

## Updates
### 11/03/2015
New experimental branch added for squareDB work. This branch is usually broken, however running a diff on this branch and master is a great way to see the coming changes.

### 10/29/2015
JATO has been renamed to Square[JS]!

### 10/27/2015
SQLish.js has been renamed to squareDB! (Structured QUery And RElational DataBase) It now supports many SQL commands (see tests/squareDBTests.js) using combinatory logic/lambda expressions for a truly awesome client-side data model.
