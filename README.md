# Square[JS]
Modern MVC Application Development, Structured Query API, & Client-Side Relational Database

## What is SquareJS?
Square is an application framework written in JavaScript that gets your project off the ground with lightning speed. The first thing that should excite you about the Square framework is the tiny footprint.  Square unminified is smaller than any other comparable minified framework!  Plus, Square provides a true MVC architecture which uses eventing rather than digest loops, HTML that validates, AJAX calls returns Promises, and the model supports both relational and non-relational approaches to storing and retrieving data.

## What about performance?
SquareJS provides awesome power and speed.  Square offers compact, powerful functions using native JavaScript methodology "under the hood" as much as possible. Most frameworks waste operations on extraneous function calls, looping mechanisms, and costly DOM lookups.  Square gets the job done using optimized code structures, multiple caching mechanisms, and best of all... you should never need to do a DOM lookup in Square.  Rather, Square caches DOM nodes you care about as properties of the view object which makes retrieval fast and easy.  Speaking of fast and easy, the view knows how to tear itself down and it cleans up all associated event handlers as it implodes.  This brings up another good point which is that Square is not only fast in terms of applications speed, it also results in rapid architecture and development.

## This framework is in Pre-Alpha
Look for daily refinements :)
Contribution instructions, license, and other stuff will be added... eventually.

## Updates
### 11/15/2015
You've tried MVC, now try SBT! SquareDB + Box + Temple = OMG! Check it out...
Just pushed a complete refactor of temple, the addition of 'box' (I love it!), and a working example showing off squareDB, the eventHub, temple, and request. ./examples/Demo_Buttons_SquareDB
the files under ./product are where the real magic lies.

### 11/13/2015
SquareDB minified added - and it's only 9kb!!! ...and I launched the SquareDB Kickstarter campaign, so that hopefully I get to make SquareJS and SquareDB the full-fledged offerings that I know they can be. https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/blujagu/squaredb

### See changelog for all previous updates.
