            SquareDB & Squobs
        </h3>

        <p>
            SquareJS includes SquareDB (Structured QUery And RElational DataBase), the only client-side relational database and query language. SquareDB
             allows developers to store client-side data in-memory using a relational data store. Data can be retrieved from the store using structured
             queries nearly identical to SQL syntax. Possible uses include one-to-one mapping of backend data to the frontend, reuse of SQL queries from
             your PHP or backend code, mapping of data objects to relational tables, SQL storage on mobile platforms, and much more. SquareDB is also
             the perfect tool for SQL instructors. Students can write and execute SQL using only a browser - no backend database, no PHP, no outside
             dependencies at all! (ok, so maybe Node, but most good IDEs will replicated a web server)
            <br/>
            Don't need a relation database on the client? No worries, SquareJS has you covered with "Squobs" (Structured QUery OBject Store), an
             in-memory, noSQL data store. Want both? No problem there, either. SquareJS supports bridging your data across both data stores allowing
             for the best of both worlds. In fact, Squobs makes a great cache in front of SquareDB, but there are so many other interesting applications
             for combined noSQL/SQL as I am sure many of you will discover. Need data binding as well? Check out the SquareJS "EventHub"...
        </p>

        <h3>
            <a id="event-hub" class="anchor" href="#event-hub" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>EventHub
        </h3>

        <p>
            EventHub enhances objects (and therefor, models) with real JavaScript eventing. This creates an environment which works like DOM eventing,
             except that all of the events are dispatched from Object nodes and can bubble up to parent nodes. Data binding is as simple as attaching
             event handlers to the model the same way you would attach them to the DOM. i.e. Model.addEventListener('model.objectNode.change', callBackFunc);
             and if you want to bind that handler directly to a DOM node, simply pass that node as a third parameter to the handler when it's instantiated.
             i.e. Model.addEventListener('model.objectNode.change', callBackFunc, domNode); This is a basic example of EventHub's capabilities, so be
             sure to check out the API documentation*, tutorials, and examples to get a better understanding of how awesome EventHub really is.
            <br />
             *Note: Documentation and tutorials will be added soon. Square.js and the Square[JS] site are both new and under active development.

            <a id="temple" class="anchor" href="#temple" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>
            Temple
        </h3>

        <p>
            I'd rather be writing JavaScript. Period. So when it came to creating a template engine the idea was simple, "make it an HTML file, make
             it validate, and make the syntax easy". Temple accomplishes all of these things in a super lightweight API that provides everything you
             need for DOM templating.
